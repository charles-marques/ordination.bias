    { "software": { "type": "uri", "value": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/WAITS" }	, "abstract": { "type": "literal", "xml:lang": "en", "value": "WAITS was a heavily modified variant of Digital Equipment Corporation's Monitor operating system (later renamed to, and better known as, \"TOPS-10\") for the PDP-6 and PDP-10 mainframe computers, used at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) from the mid-1960s up until 1991; the mainframe computer it ran on also went by the name of \"SAIL\". There was never an \"official\" expansion of WAITS, but a common variant was \"West-coast Alternative to ITS\"; another variant was \"Worst Acronym Invented for a Timesharing System\". The name was endorsed by the SAIL community in a public vote choosing among alternatives. Two of the other contenders were SAINTS (\"Stanford AI New Timesharing System\") and SINNERS (\"Stanford Incompatible Non-New Extensively Rewritten System\"), proposed by the systems programmers. Though WAITS was less visible than ITS, there was frequent exchange of people and ideas between the two communities, and innovations pioneered at WAITS exerted enormous indirect influence. WAITS alumni at Xerox PARC and elsewhere also played major roles in the developments that led to the Xerox Star, the Apple Macintosh, and the SUN workstation (later sold by Sun Microsystems). The early screen modes of Emacs, for example, were directly inspired by WAITS' \"E\" editor -- one of a family of editors that were the first to do , in which the editing commands were invisible and where one typed text at the point of insertion/overwriting. The modern style of multi-region windowing is said to have originated there. The system also featured an unusual level of support for what is now called multimedia computing, allowing analog audio and video signals (including TV and radio) to be switched to programming terminals. This switching capability for terminal video even allowed users in separate offices to view and type on the same virtual terminal, or a single user to instantly switch among multiple full virtual terminals. Also invented there were \"bucky bits\" - thus, the \"Alt\" key on every IBM PC is a WAITS legacy. One WAITS feature very notable in pre-Web days was a news-wire search engine called NS (for News Service) that allowed WAITS hackers to instantly find, store and be notified about selected AP and New York Times news-wire stories by doing searches using arbitrary combinations of words. News story retrieval by such search was instantaneous because each story was automatically indexed by all its words when it came in over the wire." }},

The game was originally offered for $6.00 per hour in 1992 via CompuServe, and then lesser amounts via the Internet, operating until December 31, 1999. Legends introduced one of the first (if not the first) crafting system in an online game. Players could harvest resources including ores, herbs and skins, and then use them to make weapons, armor and enchanted items. The game system was skill-based; players were not constrained to premade class archetypes. There were no level caps, and some very dedicated players attained levels in the hundreds. Legends of Future Past was set in the \"Shattered Realms,\" a world featuring a blend of fantasy and ancient technology. Most of the action in the game revolved around the city of Fayd, which served as the hub of activity for adventures, intrigue and roleplaying events. Some of the races included: aelfen (an elflike species), drakin (a race of dragon-men that ultimately resulted in player-created languages and cultural institutions), ephemerals (a wraithlike species that could not be harmed unless the player chose to manifest themself), highlander (think dwarves), humans (the only people who could utilize ancient technology), murg (a proud warrior race), mechanoids (artificial beings) and wolflings (a race of shapechangers). Computer Game Review awarded Legends of Future Past the Golden Triad Award. It also won the award for artistic excellence in Computer Gaming World's 1993 Online Game of the Year competition, stating that \"we were also overwhelmed by the creative power of storytelling and fertile liveliness.\" Legends is credited with spawning a number of other online games and introducing some of the top talent in the MMORPG industry. Many GameMasters and developers at Legends of Future Past went on to become founders or product managers at top online games including SOE's Star Wars Galaxies, Worlds Apart Productions and Dejobaan Games. Jon Radoff, the developer of the game, created a gaming social network called GamerDNA and has started a social gaming company Disruptor Beam which holds the license to Game of Thrones." }},

The game was released in 1999 by The Learning Company, developed by members of PF Magic working there at the time. Babyz runs on top of the Petz 3 game engine, adding additional AI and voice recognition. For example, players can teach their Babyz baby talk, how to play with objects, and how to walk. Babyz can also form relationships with other babyz that can result in sibling rivalries or friendships. When Babyz was first released in 1999, there were 15 babyz you could adopt and care for, as well as various toys that babyz could interact with. There were also many different rooms to explore and a number of different clothing items. Babyz reused some of the Petz toyz and had a similar home setting for its playscenes. Most of the game's original content can be downloaded and accessed by anyone via user-websites. Users have created ways to make the game playable with Windows XP and create custom content that users can use with their Babyz, as well as unofficial adoption centers and pages. A Babyz Community started on the official site, which has since been shut down. The website offered adoptions and discussions. Soon after, people started forming their own forums and babyz websites with similar content. \"Pageants\" are where people enter pictures of their babyz posing and earning awards. In 2003, The Babyz Community Rating System, loosely based on the Petz Community rankings, was created which allows people to register three or four of their babyz, and gain points whenever they win in a pageant. Around the same time, fan websites were going up, it was discovered that one could hex edit the babyz to introduce new hairstyles, eye colours, etc. These edited babyz (\"hexies\" or \"hexed babyz\") and custom clothes were often available on fan websites and unique babyz became highly preferred over the simple ones that the game first came with. Many fans tried to petition the game's creators for a Babyz 2, similar to the five sequels that were created for the Petz franchise, however nothing ever came of this. Today, user activity has continued to the point where many users testify that the dedicated hexers and custom content creators have banded together to essentially create their own \"Babyz 2,\" despite the discontinued support from the original creators. Babyz was originally made for the Windows 95/98 Platform, however with the creation of a patch by Nicholas Sherlock, the game can now be played in Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7; both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Sherlock's patch, called \"Petz A\" as it was intended for both Petz and Babyz, also made the game run much smoother, with the ability to change the game speed, save babyz' pictures in a different format, and also control many aspects of the game that users originally could not. It also introduced sliders to view and change the levels of the babyz' hunger, energy, sickness, and age. The Petz A patch can be found at Sherlock's website. Although not produced any longer, Babyz can still be found at various online retail sites including DirtCheapSoftware.com, Babyz.com, and through various Amazon and eBay sellers. Most of these places offer information and limited support on applying the patch for newer versions of Microsoft Windows." }},

RemoteAccess was written in Turbo Pascal with some Assembly Language routines. RemoteAccess (commonly called RA) began in 1989 as a clone of QuickBBS by Adam Hudson. RemoteAccess was released under the shareware concept in 1990 and became popular in North America, Europe, UK, South Africa, and the South Pacific. Initially the main advantage over QuickBBS was its ability to run multiple nodes under Microsoft Windows, Quarterdeck's DESQview and OS/2. RA could also operate over a network or even a combination of network and multitasking operating systems to provide multiple \"nodes per station\" capabilities. RA's features quickly grew to become considerably more advanced than the QuickBBS software it was cloned after. A number of other QuickBBS clones appeared shortly afterwards including ProBoard, SuperBBS and EzyCom, though they never gained as much support or popularity. RA was the first BBS software to support the popular JAM Message Base Format, which was partly conceived by RA's author, Andrew Milner. RA was also the first shareware BBS software to support a FDB (file database), rather than using files.bbs text files to describe files in each directory. RA interfaced with message relaying systems such as FidoNet through 3rd party utilities such as FrontDoor (Joaquim Homrighausen) and FastEcho (Tobias Burchhardt), which were developed by people who eventually became members of the RA beta team. With over 1500 titles, there were more third party utilities written for RA than for any other shareware BBS software. While RA was initially shareware, Andrew also released a commercial edition - \"RemoteAccess Professional\" - that was bundled with utilities to allow remote control of nodes over a network (RANETMGR, and RATSR). Andrew Milner released his final version of RA (2.50) in May 1996. By that time, many System Operators switched over from running Bulletin Boards to becoming Internet Service Providers. Milner was one such System Operator, and after version 2.50 he stopped development. In April 1997, Milner put the rights and source code up for sale to the highest bidder and it was sold in December 1997 to Bruce Morse in the USA. Morse released some minor updates including a Y2K fix, but did not add any new features to the code. Morse's final version (2.62) was released in August 2000. Bruce Morse continues to own the code today and RA is still available as shareware, as well as a commercial version known as RemoteAccess-Professional. RemoteAccess was never ported to a 32-bit version, but there were two clones of RA in the later years which did include 32-bit versions: EleBBS in the late 1990s which included DOS, Windows, OS/2 and Linux flavors, and MBSE, a few years later, which focused mainly on the Linux operating system. There were numerous conversations about creating Windows and OS/2 32-bit versions of RA around 1995. Joel Ricketts of Interscape Development, who was the lead programmer, answered questions in the RA echomail forum about the potential development of RA for Windows during this time. However, due to RA being put up for sale, as well as lack of funding, the project was scrapped in 1996. Around the same time, Niels Schoot from the Netherlands began writing a Visual Basic version of RA called tcRA32, which was to be fully RA compatible. The project was never finished, and within a couple of years, it was abandoned. While RemoteAccess never included internal telnet support, it can be run as a telnet BBS by using a telnet-FOSSIL driver such as NetFoss, or a Virtual COM port engine such as NetSerial under Windows, or using SIO/VMODEM under OS/2." }},

Players can take on various roles depending on choice of race and choice of class within that race. Characters develop skills over time with experience and level up via questing rewards and can use and upgrade physical and magical weapons, and team up with other players to fight against monsters in instances, bosses on the open world as well as other players. Very often, people will sell their accounts which saves buying the items from the in game cash shop, farming experience and gaining the skills needed. This option is ideal after the removal of most PvE coin making methods due to PW now being focused on PvP paying players. Each player can join a guild (if accepted) and thereby be part of a 200 maximum player base with common goals to achieve. The PW map is broken into a large number of territories which gives guilds an option to conquer and govern such territories via Territory War for reward of ownership usually in the form of coins which are used back to benefit the guild and its players. Territory War is 80 players VS 80 players, strategic battle which has a 3-hour maximum time cap with each class belonging to a race having unique roles to perform and teamwork and strategy is key to sustain victory. On the US version of PW, Territory War time cap was reduced to 1 hour 40 minutes due to the low player base numbers and low number of players attending. Currently, there is no real emphasis from the player base towards participating in Territory War due to useless rewards. Certain factions still choose to attend however, but most of the fights are completed in 15/20 mins due to other factions not being interested. Twilight Temple and Dawnglory servers currently have the most competitive Territory War seasons followed by Tideswell and then Etherblade server, which the latter has only had 1 faction intent on winning Territory Wars over the past few seasons.

Director Hifumi Kono loved horror films like this and wanted the game to feel like one. Many of the game's character graphics were digitized from photos of real people. Jennifer's movements were constructed from a woman in Human's planning division acting out the scenes. Her design was inspired by Jennifer Connelly's character in Phenomena. The game sold \"fairly well\" upon release. An updated version, titled Clock Tower: The First Fear was ported to the PlayStation, WonderSwan, and Windows. Many years later, it was re-released again on the PlayStation Network, as well as Wii and Wii U Virtual Console. The game has never been officially released outside Japan, although fan translations exist. In retrospective reviews, Clock Tower has been praised for its haunting atmosphere and is considered a predecessor to other horror video games and the survival horror genre, but the puzzles and exploration drew criticism for being tedious." }},

When it is run, it creates a bar at the top of the screen that greatly magnifies where the mouse is. Magnifier was first included as a sample in the Active Accessibility SDK/RDK for Windows 95 and later made a standard Windows utility starting with Windows 98. Prior to Windows Vista, Magnifier could be used to magnify the screen up to 9 times its normal size. Windows Vista and later allow up to 16\u00D7 magnification.In Windows Vista, Magnifier uses WPF, which in turn uses vector images to render the content. As a result, the rendered magnified image is sharp and not pixelated. However, this is useful only for Windows Presentation Foundation applications. Non-WPF applications are still magnified the traditional way. Also, due to a change introduced in WPF 3.5 SP1, this functionality is lost if .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 is installed.Microsoft has also released a Magnification API to allow assistive technology applications to use the Magnifier engine.Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system includes a significantly improved version of Magnifier. It features full-screen magnification which allows a user to pan around the screen at up to 16\u00D7 magnification.However, the full screen feature has also been criticized due to its incompatibility with the high contrast color schemes found in the Windows 7 beta release. This issue remains in the final Windows 7 release. Besides this, when the magnifier zooms, the text will appear blurry or pixelated because it is not being directly rendered at the larger size; instead, the smaller sized rendering is being enlarged as a raster image. ClearType sub-pixel anti-aliasing is also magnified as a result of this, so if ClearType is active, the magnified text may appear to have unexpected colors at the edges of non-horizontal lines. Some third party magnification software compensates for this effect by applying scaling filters to the enlarged image.The magnifier also features a lens mode similar to that found in the existing version of the software. Lens mode is improved, however, as now the magnifying window will follow the cursor around the screen rather than remain in a fixed position. Finally the magnifier is much easier to access by using the Windows key and +/- to control the zoom level without the need to start the application first. Pressing the Win+Esc combination will exit the magnifier." }},

In order to create an accurate environment and be consistent with Tolkien's books, the developers consulted many people from Warner Brothers, as well as Peter Jackson, director of the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film trilogies. They also received assistance from Weta Workshop, who advised on the special effects. Monolith focused on the development of the PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One versions, while the development of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions was outsourced to Behaviour Interactive.Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor received critical acclaim upon release. Most praise was directed at its combat, open-world design, and the Nemesis System. Some criticism was aimed at the game's story and boss battles.

It has been featured as a \"Best New App\" in the iPhone App Store and has been featured on Product Hunt. Users include teens as well as celebrities, including actor Bellamy Young (Scandal), who hosted an Unmute call with thousands of listeners. Unmute has been compared to the livestreaming applications YouNow and Periscope, though Unmute is audio-only. Unmute was developed by Justin Spraggins in April 2015 and launched in November. The app features audio streams between users, or calls, that can be listened in on by other users though the app. Listeners can contribute to the dialogue with text comment and photos. The hosts of the calls can choose to \"unmute\" the listeners, and allow them to take part in the conversation like a call-in talk show. The calls are recorded and can be listen to after the call is completed. Users include Bellamy Young, who plays Mellie Grant in the ABC series Scandal. Spraggins said the idea for Unmute came to him while sitting in traffic and he felt that people were losing out in having actual conversations, as texting gained prominence as a communications tool. \"So I knew that at that moment the phone call needs a social facelift. It\u2019s not cool anymore, so how do we make it cool again?\" he said. As of January 2016, Spraggins told Business Insider Unmute was growing 100 percent week over week and with about 1 million minutes of streaming audio consumed on the platform. The app has raised $2.2 million in seed funding from Greycroft Partners, Comcast Ventures, former NBA commissioner David Stern, and Robert Kirkman, the creator of The Walking Dead comic series." }},

Created by a person using the alias 'Grngecko', the puzzle is widely known for being unsolved for over 4 years. Almost nothing was known about 'Grngecko' apart that from he/she is the creator of the game, until his email account was hacked by members of Anonymous in May 2011. In June 2011, Grngecko declared the puzzle over with the words \"Show's over, go home\" on the popular puzzle site Tweleve after provocation from a member of the site. Since then the Torment site, and all affiliated sites (deaddrop.cc, themostabtruse.com) have been closed, although the Torment site itself has since been online.Torment features different levels or stages that one must complete in order to complete the game. The game features extremely difficult puzzles, mostly cryptograms. The player must figure out the cipher before progressing onto the next stage. An example of such a cipher is the one used in Edgar Allan Poe's story \"The Gold-Bug\", commonly referred to as the Gold Bug cipher. On each stage, one or more images, pictures or gif files are featured. These images usually give hints to the desired answer. Some cryptograms may contain coordinates leading to a historical figure or object, which the players must name.Different internet forum users have created threads in order to try to solve the puzzle, each one being unsuccessful. Users mainly try to only give subtle hints to each other, rather than handing out solutions, much because Grngecko does not want the game to become too easy. Multiple red herrings and dead-ends have been put into the game by Grngecko. For example, typing \"man\" into the solution key will bring you to a picture of worms with no way to advance. Certain red herrings make it look like there is a way to advance, even though there is not. For obvious reasons, Grngecko has included red herrings into the game for people trying to cheat their way through. Typing in \"theend\" brings you to a page that follows no pattern to other pages, which in that case most players would describe it as a red herring.The site was offline, presumed dead, as of June 2011, but has since reemerged with an entirely new set of puzzles. Typing in old puzzle URLs will lead you to the index page.As of February 2012, after roughly a month of various changes, including the removal of the answer box on the newest puzzle page, Grngecko.com stopped hosting the Torment puzzle altogether. It was moved to a new domain, \"www.themostabstruse.com/torment.html\", where the newest puzzle from Grngecko.com was used as the first puzzle, making it seem as though Grngecko was attempting to reset Torment. However, the website was destroyed soon after being posted for unknown reasons.Currently, there is no known trace of the puzzle on the internet." }},

It was ported to Mac OS by Shokwave, and to the PlayStation by Neversoft. It was published on all systems by PIE in North America, with Shiny Entertainment publishing it themselves in Europe. The Windows version was released in April 1997, the Mac version in June and the PlayStation version in November. The game was released on GOG.com in September 2008, and on Steam in September 2009.The game tells the story of Kurt Hectic, a janitor who reluctantly must attempt to save Earth from an alien invasion of gigantic strip mining city-sized vehicles named \"Minecrawlers\". These Minecrawlers are removing all of earth's natural resources, and crushing any people and cities that get in their way. Aided by his boss, the possibly insane inventor and scientist Dr. Fluke Hawkins, and a robotic two-legged/four-armed dog named Bones, Kurt must infiltrate each Minecrawler, and fight his way to the pilot, whom he must then kill before returning to Hawkins' in-orbit space station, the Jim Dandy.Conceived and co-designed by Nick Bruty, MDK was Shiny's first PC game, and was notable for using software rendering, requiring a Pentium or equivalent microprocessor, rather than necessitating any GPU enhancements, despite its large 3D levels and complex polygon-based enemies. As the developers were attempting things never before seen in a PC game, they had to write their own programming language from scratch. Additionally, when in sniper mode, the player has the ability to zoom up to 100x, but the developers chose not to employ any of the standard solutions to pop-up, such as clipping or fogging. They also worked to ensure the game ran at a minimum of 30fps at all times on all machines. The game's original system requirements were a 60MHz Pentium, 16MB of RAM, 17MB of hard drive storage, an SVGA compatible video card, and a Sound Blaster or equivalent sound card; modest specs even by the standards of the time.MDK received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the gameplay, the level design, the sardonic sense of humor, the game's technical accomplishments and, in particular, the use of sniper mode. The most oft repeated criticisms were that the game was too short and the story was weak. The game was a commercial success, and Interplay approached Bruty to work on a sequel immediately. However, he was already developing Giants: Citizen Kabuto, and so BioWare was hired to develop the game. MDK2 was published for Windows and the Dreamcast in 2000, and for the PlayStation 2 (as MDK 2: Armageddon) in 2001. In 2007, Interplay announced a third game was planned, but it was never made." }},

It was released in Japan in March 2004, and in North America in September 2004. The game resulted from a school project from the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory and was developed for less than US$1 million. In designing Katamari Damacy, the development team lead by Keita Takahashi aimed to maintain three key points: novelty, ease of understanding, and enjoyment. The game's plot concerns a diminutive prince on a mission to rebuild the stars, constellations, and Moon, which were accidentally destroyed by his father, the King of All Cosmos. This is achieved by rolling a magical, highly adhesive ball called a katamari around various locations, collecting increasingly larger objects, ranging from thumbtacks to people to mountains until the ball has grown great enough to become a star. Katamari Damacy's story, characters, and settings are bizarre and heavily stylized, rarely attempting any semblance of realism, though the brands and items used are based on those current in Japan during the game's production. Overall, Katamari Damacy was well received in Japan and North America. The game was dubbed a sleeper hit and won several awards. The successor of the game led to the creation of the Katamari franchise, and inspired the development of other video games. A high-definition remaster of the game, Katamari Damacy Reroll, was released on Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch in December 2018." }},

The story follows Nero, a teenager possessing demonic powers who is on a mission to stop the series' main character, Dante, after he assassinates demons and the leader of the Order of the Sword. The player controls both Nero and Dante as they fight enemies in close combat using firearms, swords, and other weapons. Devil May Cry 4 was the first entry in the series to be released simultaneously for multiple consoles. During its development, Capcom focused on each version achieving the same visual quality using the MT Framework game engine. Around eighty people formed the team that created the game. Nero was introduced to attract new gamers. Dante's popularity with gamers proved challenging because the developers needed to use him as a supporting character in the story. Critical reception to Devil May Cry 4 was positive. It was praised for its challenging difficulty, its visuals and Nero's characterization as a new protagonist. However, it was criticized for its backtracking in Dante's stages and a troublesome camera. The game sold over three million units worldwide, becoming the series' best-selling title. Bingo Morihashi adapted it into a two-volume light novel. It was later released on iOS as Devil May Cry 4: Refrain. A remastered version of the game was released in June 2015 as Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition, which adds both English and Japanese voice tracks, improved visual effects and textures, in-game re-balancing, additional costumes, and three bonus playable characters: Vergil, Lady and Trish.

It was one of the first donationware programs to be distributed on the internet. It was written by Scott Watson, who founded  of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. By spending no money on advertising, but simply offering Red Ryder on Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs), Watson marketed and distributed what became a popular communications program for the Macintosh. He did not sell it in any retail store. All he asked of those who downloaded the program was that they might send him $40. He later said, \"I took advantage of a problem: piracy. Many program-users copied them free. I assumed that, if I offered something free and asked people who liked it to pay, that some people would; that maybe I'd get a bigger percentage than people who sell software.\" This new kind of \"on approval\" selling worked well and there was no necessity for follow-up. The cost was a fraction of available competitive software. Many people who found the software useful sent in checks. Each BBS sent the program online free to anyone. Anyone who liked Red Ryder could copy it for friends and pass the word to others, who then got Red Ryder from their bulletin board systems. Macintosh magazines rated Red Ryder highly. Watson rejected orders from both computer stores and distributors and concentrated on development. Many new bulletin boards ran his offer. Watson then came up with a program allowing anyone to create a BBS. It was called Red Ryder Host, later renamed Second Sight. Watson introduced the new program as he had Red Ryder, on bulletin boards. By then, Watson operated his own bulletin board; anyone could order directly from him. He had proved the power of the simplest bulletin boards for the marketing and distribution of media. Red Ryder Host served as a BBS shell. The software allowed a BBS to have public message boards, private message boards, file download libraries, and various levels of access that could be set for each individual, external system user. Red Ryder was ultimately replaced by a commercial package called \"White Knight.\"" }},

By 2013, Second Life had approximately one million regular users; at the end of 2017 active user count totals \"between 800,000 and 900,000\". In many ways, Second Life is similar to massively multiplayer online role-playing games; however, Linden Lab is emphatic that their creation is not a game: \"There is no manufactured conflict, no set objective\". The virtual world can be accessed freely via Linden Lab's own client programs or via alternative third-party viewers. Second Life users, also called residents, create virtual representations of themselves, called avatars, and are able to interact with places, objects and other avatars. They can explore the world (known as the grid), meet other residents, socialize, participate in both individual and group activities, build, create, shop, and trade virtual property and services with one another. The platform principally features 3D-based user-generated content. Second Life also has its own virtual currency, the Linden Dollar, which is exchangeable with real world currency. Second Life is intended for people aged 16 and over, with the exception of 13\u201315-year-old users, who are restricted to the Second Life region of a sponsoring institution (e.g., a school). Built into the software is a 3D modeling tool based on simple geometric shapes that allows residents to build virtual objects. There is also a procedural scripting language, Linden Scripting Language, which can be used to add interactivity to objects. Sculpted prims (sculpties), mesh, textures for clothing or other objects, animations, and gestures can be created using external software and imported. The Second Life terms of service provide that users retain copyright for any content they create, and the server and client provide simple digital rights management (DRM) functions. However, Linden Lab changed their terms of service in August 2013 to be able to use user-generated content for any purpose. The new terms of service prevent users from using textures from third-party texture services, as some of them pointed out explicitly." }},

The game was released on October 6, 2009, in North America and later that year in other regions. The Microsoft Windows version was released on October 22, 2009. Part of the Saw film franchise, the game is set between the first and second films. In Saw, The Jigsaw Killer has healed Detective David Tapp from his gunshot wound, and places him in an abandoned insane asylum to teach him a lesson in life appreciation. Obsessed, Tapp traverses the asylum and gathers clues along the way in hopes of apprehending Jigsaw. As he progresses through the asylum, he encounters several people with connections to him, whom he must save. The asylum also has inhabitants who are in games of their own, ordered to kill Tapp. Along the way, Tapp uncovers the origins of Jigsaw and the motives behind his tests. The development team brought in the Saw creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell to help with the storyline and create new trap designs for the game. Upon release, Saw received mixed reviews. It was praised for the storyline and multiple endings, as well as the immersive environment that is true to the Saw film series. The controls and combat system, however, were panned by critics. Since Konami purchased the publishing rights after former publisher Brash Entertainment went bankrupt, Konami had a significant input on the games' final outcome. They stated that they had plans to make Saw their next big franchise as well as a spiritual successor to their other survival horror series, Silent Hill. A sequel, Saw II: Flesh & Blood, was released on multiple platforms on October 19, 2010." }},

The name is an acronym for \"Adventure Development & Runner - Interactive Fiction Toolkit\". The project is solely developed by Campbell Wild. The toolkit consists of two programs; a generator (used to write games), and a runner (used to play them), though the runner is available to download separately. In the current stable release (version 4.0.51), released in 2002, both programs only run on Microsoft Windows platforms as they are written in Visual Basic. The generator is shareware (adventures over a certain size cannot be saved until a registration fee of 18.95 USD - around 12 GBP is paid), though the runner is available free to everyone. Older (freeware) versions of the program can also be downloaded on the website. However, version 5 is now donationware, enabling full functionality of the software without requiring payment. The runner program is also able to run on Linux using the Mono project. A Mac version is expected soon. Coinciding with the 2011 Interactive Fiction competition, ADRIFT WebRunner was launched. This allows any ADRIFT game to be played online. Because the game runs server side, it allows games to be played on any device such as iPad. Unlike many text adventure creation tools (such as TADS), the author needs little knowledge of how to program to use the ADRIFT generator. Instead, the author is presented with a simple graphical interface with which to write their game. This allows for text adventures to be written more quickly by people who are primarily authors rather than programmers. Two of the most critically acclaimed ADRIFT games to date are The PK Girl, which achieved 6th place in the Interactive Fiction Competition in 2002, and A Fine Day for Reaping, which took 7th place in the Interactive Fiction Competition and won the XYZZY Award for Best Story in 2007. The next major version, version 5, is being written in Visual Basic.net. ADRIFT 5 went into Beta  status as from 4 April 2011, where it is open for everyone to download." }},

It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in video game history for having helped to pioneer, along with the 1992 game Wolfenstein 3D, the now-ubiquitous FPS gameplay type, and has been frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via shareware and mail order. The Ultimate Doom, an updated version featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail. In Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as \"Doomguy\", fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell. With one entire third of the game (nine levels) freely distributed as shareware, it was played by an estimated 15\u201320 million people within two years of its release. Doom made a massive global impact: it popularized the business model of online distribution; it popularized the FPS genre of gameplay and spawned a gaming subculture; and it pioneered the technologies of immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive (\"WADs\") which are now called downloadable content (DLC). As a sign of its effect on the industry, FPS games from the genre's boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game's release, became known simply as \"Doom clones\". Its graphic violence and hellish imagery made it the subject of considerable controversy. The Doom franchise continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous expansion packs, including Master Levels for Doom II (1995) and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for MS-DOS, those games have been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game's source code was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations and modernizations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices, even to machines that were not designed to run games. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making WADs, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular attention, more than ten years after its foundation with the release of Doom 3 (2004), a retelling of the original game using the id Tech 4 engine, with an associated 2005 Doom motion picture. A reboot of the series, also simply titled Doom but this time powered by id Tech 6, was released in 2016, and focused on returning to the fast-paced action of the first two games." }},

Currently, Lunar supports the i686 and x86-64 architecture, but has been implemented by users on SPARC. No install support is planned for non-x86 architectures at the moment. Lunar began as a fork of Sorcerer because of concern over the uncertain future of the distribution. Kyle Sallee, the sole maintainer and lead developer of Sorcerer, decided to re-license all the Sorcerer code into his own custom, non-forking license called the Sorcerer Public License, as a way to stop people from \"stealing\" his work after Lunar forked. This move caused the rest of the Sorcerer development team to splinter off and form what is essentially a direct continuation of the last version of Sorcerer licensed under the GNU General Public License, called Source Mage.

An enhanced version was released for mobile platforms in 2012, for the game's tenth anniversary. It is the sixth title in the Grand Theft Auto series and the first main entry since 2001's Grand Theft Auto III. Set within the fictional Vice City, based on Miami, the game follows Tommy Vercetti following his release from prison. After he is caught up in an ambushed drug deal, he seeks out those responsible while building a criminal empire and seizing power from other criminal organisations in the city. The game is played from a third-person perspective, and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The open world design lets the player freely roam Vice City, consisting of two main islands. The game's plot is based on multiple real-world people and events in Miami such as Cuban, Haitian, and biker gangs, the 1980s crack epidemic, the Mafioso drug lords of Miami, and the dominance of glam metal.

Initially, a search returns few results, but one can set up \"clusters\" based on certain keywords, and over time, one's client will learn the best route to obtain the information sought.The software was developed by Isamu Kaneko, who was a research assistant in graduate course of computer engineering at the University of Tokyo in Japan. He was also once a researcher at the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute. Kaneko originally anonymously announced his intent of developing the software on the Download Software board of the popular 2channel (2ch for short) Japanese bulletin board site. Since 2ch users often refer to anonymous users by their post numbers, Kaneko came to be known as \"Mr. 47\" (\"47-Shi\", or 47\u6C0F in Japanese), or just \"47\". Kaneko died on the 6 July 2013 after suffering a heart attack.After Winny's development stopped, a new peer-to-peer application, Share, was developed by an anonymous Japanese engineer to replace Winny." }},

There are no practical limits to the precision except the ones implied by the available memory (operand dimension limit is 232-1 bits on 32-bit machines and 237 bits on 64-bit machines). GMP has a rich set of functions, and the functions have a regular interface. The basic interface is for C but wrappers exist for other languages including Ada, C++, C#, Julia, .NET, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, R, Ruby and the Wolfram Language. In the past, Kaffe, a Java virtual machine, used GMP to support Java built-in arbitrary precision arithmetic. This feature has been removed from recent releases, causing protests from people who claim that they used Kaffe solely for the speed benefits afforded by GMP. As a result, GMP support has been added to GNU Classpath. The main target applications of GMP are cryptography applications and research, Internet security applications, and computer algebra systems. GMP aims to be faster than any other bignum library for all operand sizes. Some important factors in doing this are: \n* Using full words as the basic arithmetic type. \n* Using different algorithms for different operand sizes; algorithms that are faster for very big numbers are usually slower for small numbers. \n* Highly optimized assembly language code for the most important inner loops, specialized for different processors. The first GMP release was made in 1991. It is constantly developed and maintained. GMP is part of the GNU project (although its website being off gnu.org may cause confusion), and is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). GMP is used for integer arithmetic in many computer algebra systems such as Mathematica and Maple. It is also used in the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) because geometry algorithms tend to 'explode' when using ordinary floating point CPU math. GMP is needed to build the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)." }},

Set in a fictionalized, free-roam, open world version of Chicago, the single-player story follows hacker Aiden Pearce's search for revenge after the killing of his niece. The game is played from a third-person perspective, and the world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. An online multiplayer mode allows up to eight players to engage in cooperative and competitive gameplay. Development of the game began in 2009, and continued for over five years. Duties were shared by many of Ubisoft's studios worldwide, with more than a thousand people involved. The developers visited Chicago to conduct field research on the setting, and used regional language for authenticity. Hacking features were created in consultation with the cyber-security company Kaspersky Lab, and the in-game control system was based on SCADA. The score was composed by Brian Reitzell, who infused it with krautrock. Following its announcement in June 2012, Watch Dogs was widely anticipated. Upon release, it received a mixed reception; praise was directed at the game's hacking elements and mission variety, while criticism was expressed concerning the discrepancy in graphics quality between marketing and the real game, plot, and protagonist.

It featured the 'Career Mode' concept from Formula One 04, which allows players to work their way through the Formula One teams over the course of five years (albeit a repeat version of the 2005 season each time). This game also supports EyeToy: Cameo, allowing players to place their own face on a driver when creating their profile, but unlike F1 04, though they cannot choose their own helmet at the start, the player assumes a white unmarked helmet and only later unlocks other colours and designs. The cover athletes are Jenson Button, David Coulthard and Narain Karthikeyan. Players start out testing for smaller teams (Minardi, Jordan and Red Bull Racing (Like in F1 04, a generic car does exist, but it is only used in Time Attack mode)). Players then work their way up the grid throughout their 'career' through a mixture of good tests and impressive race performances. As before, consistently poor performances will lead to dismissal from the player's current team. There are also occasional 'shoot-out' tests against the team's second driver (or third driver, depending on the player's current status within the team), in which both drivers complete a set of five laps each and whoever has the fastest overall time (one time based on the fastest first, second and third sectors added together) then takes the race seat. Players can now also view trophies they have received from winning races and championships after each is won in Career Mode for the first time. As with F1 04, \"classic\" cars (like the Williams FW11) are unlocked once certain terms are fulfilled, such as winning a World Championship. Helmets for Career Mode are also unlocked, and there is also a hidden track (the Detroit street circuit which was used for Detroit Grand Prix and the Paul Ricard circuit in France()) available for Time Attack Mode. Notably, since this game was developed before the change in the qualifying regulations midway through the actual 2005 season, this game runs the original \"aggregated times\" format from the early part of the actual 2005 season in every race in Race Weekend, Championship and Career Mode. This game also has Net Play available. A notable credit is the opening video features the song \"Butterflies & Hurricanes\" from English alternative rock band Muse. For the first time in a number of years, the fans agreed that this was a massive improvement in the series and the shot in the arm it had so desperately needed. A lot of people had criticised Studio Liverpool for the lack of ambition and progress since the series appeared on the PS2 platform up to that point. With the release of Formula One 05, people saw that great strides had been made by Studio Liverpool in terms of gameplay handling and AI. However, there were criticisms in terms of the AI being too easy on the hardest of settings, and about the penalty system that had been introduced on Formula One 05 which automatically reduced the revs during a penalty instead of the traditional \"drive-through\" penalties that previous games had seen. Overall though, the fans agreed that apart from these minor issues, Studio Liverpool had redeveloped the brand as a stepping stone for improvement for the inevitable release of the 2006 edition. The game features all the drivers and tracks from the 2005 season, but does not represent the replacement drivers that featured in the real F1 season, therefore Vitantonio Liuzzi, Alexander Wurz, Ricardo Zonta, Anthony Davidson, Pedro de la Rosa, Robert Doornbos and Ant\u00F4nio Pizzonia are not featured." }},

The \"holographic\" effect is an optical illusion using a large curved mirror (invented by Dentsu) and a CRT television set. The game's premise is that American old west cowboy Marshal Gram (played by Stephen Wilber, also hired to coordinate the game's stunts) is required to save the universe from scientist turned evil time lord Vulcor, who's found a way to manipulate and distort time itself; and to also rescue Princess Kyi-La (played by LeAnn McVicker) of the Galactic Federation, whom Vulcor is holding prisoner in his quest to disrupt the flow of time.

In April 1999, Blue Byte released an expansion, The Settlers III Mission CD, featuring new single-player campaign missions, new maps for both single-player and multiplayer modes, and a map editor. In October, they released a second expansion, The Settlers III: Quest of the Amazons (German: Die Siedler III: Das Geheimnis der Amazonen), containing two new single-player campaigns, additional single-player and multiplayer maps, and an enhanced editor. In June 2000, The Settlers III: Gold Edition was released, containing the original game and both expansions, plus fan-made maps for single-player and multiplayer modes, a new Easy difficulty setting for single-player games, HTML hints and tips, and minor graphical enhancements and gameplay tweaks. In 2013, the Gold Edition was released on GOG.com under its North American title, The Settlers III: Ultimate Collection, and in 2018, it was re-released as The Settlers III: History Edition. In the game's single-player campaign, the player controls one of three races (Romans, Egyptians or Asians) whose respective deities are summoned by the great god HE, after HE becomes dissatisfied with how the lesser gods are ruling. HE tells them they must each pick a champion from among their people, and have him lead a war against the other peoples, with the gods of the two losing races facing an arduous and absurd punishment. Quest of the Amazons tells a prequel story, chronicling how Helios's daughter, Q'nq\u00FCra, becomes HIS personal assistant, engineering events so that women become the secret rulers of the universe. Quest allows the player to choose from one of two campaigns; either controlling the Amazons against the other three races, or controlling the combined forces of the others against the Amazons. The game was designed and co-programmed by Volker Wertich, creator of the original Settlers game. Having consulted fan feedback from the first two games, Wertich wanted to expand the scope of the third installment as much as possible, whilst preserving the elements which made the series unique. Although the core supply and demand-based gameplay is broadly the same as in previous titles, many of the game mechanics have been altered. For example, combat is more involved, with the player given direct control over their army; roads are no longer necessary to connect buildings, as all settlers can now walk freely around the player's territory; headquarters no longer automatically generate settlers as required, instead the player must build residences to gain new settlers; and the different races are no longer merely aesthetically differentiated, they now have different economic models, different magic spells, different war machines, and several unique abilities and buildings. The game was also the first in the series to feature online multiplayer, the addition of which had been one of the main requests from fans. The Settlers III received mixed reviews. Although acclaimed in its native Germany, where it was heralded as the best game in the series thus far, the international reaction was more muted. Whilst the economic system and the interrelatedness of the various buildings were generally praised, and the graphics and animations especially lauded, most critics felt it was too similar to previous Settlers titles, with the changes to the mechanics seen as not enough to fully differentiate it from its predecessors. The game was a commercial success, selling over 200,000 units in Germany within the first twelve months of its release, and ultimately going on to sell over 700,000 units worldwide." }},

Nations can belong to civilizations ranging from the Romans and Carthaginians in the west, to the West Indians and Chinese in the east. The official website can be found at Strength & Honour The setting is around 200 BC. You choose your ruler and kingdom. You hand pick the members of your cabinet, governors of your cities, and the marshals and generals of your armies. Each Character in the game has a number of attributes which dictates their personality. Among these attributes include honor, ambition, loyalty, political ability, leadership ability, fighting ability, naval ability, and popularity. Each of these attributes may help you decide which character is the most appropriate to be appointed to your cabinate position. A few traits will not change in an individual, Honor and ambition are examples of traits that do not change. A person with high honor will have a much slower rate of change in loyalty if they become unhappy. If you have a loyal character with very low honor and very high ambition, watch out because this person is very unstable and may turn disloyal at any time. Most characters in Strength and Honor do not like working for people with low popularity and may rebel against you if they find themselves being a subordinate to one of low popularity. Characters with high political ability make your best governors and ministers. The higher political ability will allow them to successfully run administrative type positions. Because you are dependent on a large economy, characters with high political skills and popularity is a way to increase the populous and recruitment of personnel into your armies and cities. Besides the promoting of personnel you also have direct control through taxes for each city under your control as well as a national tax for your kingdom. Be cautious of over taxing your populous, it may result in decreasing your populous as people leave your cities. Libraries provide influence over a city's philosophy. Military philosophy will produce better generals, but a mercantilism or agrarianism type of philosophy may boost a cities economy.

An add-on disc titled Persona 3 FES, containing a \"director's cut\" of the original game, as well as a new epilogue, was released alongside Persona 3 in Japan in 2007, and in 2008 in other territories, with a re-release of FES on the PlayStation Network in 2012.In Persona 3, the player takes the role of a male high-school student who joins the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad (SEES), a group of students investigating the Dark Hour, a time period between one day and the next that few people are aware of. During the Dark Hour, the player enters Tartarus, a large tower containing Shadows, creatures that feed on the minds of humans. To fight the Shadows, each member of SEES is able to summon a Persona, a manifestation of a person's inner self. The game's most iconic feature is the method by which the members of SEES release their Personas: by firing a gun-like object called an Evoker at their head. In addition to the standard elements of role-playing games, Persona 3 includes elements of simulation games, as the game's protagonist progresses day by day through a school year, making friends and forming relationships that improve the strength of his Personas in battle.Critical reception of Persona 3 was mainly positive; reviewers enjoyed the game's social elements, while some found its combat and environments repetitive. Persona 3 FES's epilogue was said to give narrative closure to the original game, although it was criticized for not featuring the simulation aspect of Persona 3. A PlayStation Portable version of Persona 3, titled Persona 3 Portable was released in Japan in November 2009, in North America in July 2010, and in Europe in April 2011. The remake adds the ability to play as a female protagonist, new story elements and music, and a new interface designed for the PSP.

A Linux port was released in August 2017. A port for the Nintendo DS was also in development, but never released due to Suda's dissatisfaction with the final product. The setting is contemporary Japan, and takes place in a universe which would be used by Suda in later works. Within a city called the 24 Districts, a series of bizarre murders occurs, prompting the 24 Districts Police Department to send two detectives from their Heinous Crimes Unit to solve the case. The killings are soon linked to Kamui Uehara, a notorious serial killer who supposedly died several years before. The gameplay revolves around text-based situations, point-and-click mechanics, and interactive question and answer segments. The Silver Case was the debut title of Grasshopper Manufacture, beginning development with the studio's formation in 1998. As they had limited staff and resources, Suda devised the window-based story-telling to make best use of their assets. The story, written by Suda, Masahi Ooka and Sako Kato revolved around themes of crime and the clashing of people on different sides: its themes would become a recurring feature in later titles developed by Suda. The character designs were done by Takashi Miyamoto, while the music was composed by Masafumi Takada. Prior to its remaster, the game did not see a release outside Japan, despite Suda wanting a Western release: this was attributed by Suda and others to concerns over properly translating and localizing the game's dialogue and text-based puzzles. The localization was handled by Active Gaming Media in collaboration with Grasshopper Manufacture. The original version was positively reviewed in Japan, while the remaster received generally mixed opinions from journalists. A sequel for mobiles was released in 2005, receiving a remake following the success of the remaster's release." }},

In play, players control a hero character who is charged with saving the Kingdom of Alefgard and rescuing its princess from the evil Dragonlord. Dragon Warrior's story became the second part in a trilogy. Several more anime and manga series, which revolved around this overarching plot were created.Dragon Quest was created by Yuji Horii, who took inspiration from previous role-playing games such as Wizardry, Ultima, and his own 1983 title The Portopia Serial Murder Case. Horii wanted to create an RPG which would appeal to a wide audience of people who were unfamiliar with the genre of video games in general. He tried to place a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement, as well as simplify the interface and expose the mostly Western computer genre to the Japanese console market. Manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama produced the game's artwork and Koichi Sugiyama composed its music. The North American version featured numerous changes, including battery-backed RAM save games (rather than using a password save system), modified character sprites and pseudo-Elizabethan English style dialog.Dragon Quest was commercially successful in Japan, with more than 2 million copies sold. Its release as Dragon Warrior in North America, and other Western countries, was less favorably received. Later, Western critics noted the game's shortcomings but acknowledged its importance to the genre. Its original pseudo-Elizabethan English script has been praised in many of these reviews. Fan-made ROM hacks were released with substantial changes to the game. The game's sound effects have also been orchestrated, and its music has been performed at numerous concerts.

The game was released on September 25, 2007, in Australia, Brazil, India, New Zealand, North America, and Singapore; September 26, 2007, in Europe; and September 27, 2007, in Japan. Halo 3's story centers on the interstellar war between twenty-sixth century humanity, a collection of alien races known as the Covenant, and the alien parasite Flood. The player assumes the role of the Master Chief, a cybernetically enhanced supersoldier, as he battles the Covenant and the Flood. The game features vehicles, weapons, and gameplay elements not present in previous titles of the series, as well as the addition of saved gameplay films, file sharing, and the Forge map editor\u2014a utility which allows the player to perform modifications to multiplayer levels. Bungie began developing Halo 3 shortly after Halo 2 shipped. The game was officially announced at E3 2006, and its release was preceded by a multiplayer beta open to select players who purchased the Xbox 360 game Crackdown. Microsoft spent $40 million on marketing the game, in an effort to sell more game consoles and broaden the appeal of the game beyond the established Halo fanbase. Marketing included cross-promotions and an alternate reality game. On the day before its official release, 4.2 million units of Halo 3 were in retail outlets. Halo 3 grossed US$300 million in its first week. More than one million people played Halo 3 on Xbox Live in the first twenty hours.

The game was also the best-selling video game of 2007 in the U.S. Overall, the game was very well received by critics, with the Forge and multiplayer offerings singled out as strong features; however, some reviewers criticized single-player aspects, especially the plot and campaign layout.

The PlayStation Vita port was developed by Wolfgame and published by Limited Run Games. The game puts the player in the role of a bartender at the eponymous VA-11 HALL-A, a small bar in a dystopian downtown which is said to attract the \"most fascinating\" of people. The gameplay consists of players making and serving drinks to bar attendees whilst listening to the stories and experiences of these said characters. VA-11 HALL-A contains nonlinear gameplay, with the game's plotline being influenced by the drinks the player makes and how the customers react to them. There are no dialogue options within the game, with making different drinks being the sole way to influence the direction of the story. VA-11 HALL-A features a diverse range of characters that have been described as \"average non-heroes\", with developers noting how they were based on side characters that were never truly fleshed out in movies. Over time, the player begins to know the characters well enough to infer what drinks they want, resulting in an intimate experience. VA-11 HALL-A was originally developed for the Cyberpunk Game Jam of 2014; however, Sukeban Games liked the game so much that they eventually turned it into a full game. The original planned release date of December 2014 has since been moved back multiple times due to delays, including when the developers changed the game engine. VA-11 HALL-A draws heavy influences from old PC-98 games, resulting in a retro yet futuristic look, as well as the developers' own experiences of living in a poorer country. The game's original prototype is downloadable for free on the game's official website, and players who pre-order gain access to a playable yet separate prologue. VA-11 HALL-A has garnered pre-release critical acclaim, while post-game reception was mostly favourable, with positive reception directed at its premise, cast of characters, and music.

The game is a detective murder-mystery; it begins with nine people, including Patrick Narracott, the playable character, who meet and journey to the fictional Shipwreck Island. There, two additional onscreen characters are introduced, and the story then follows the events that unfold.And Then There Were None retains most of the basic plot elements of Agatha Christie's novel of the same name; the major differences are the inclusion of the playable character, Patrick Narracott, and the creation of a range of possible endings. To further the connection between the game and its source material, Christie's novel was included in the North American PC release of the game. Agatha Christie: And Then There Were None was followed by two more games, Agatha Christie: Murder on the Orient Express and Agatha Christie: Evil Under the Sun. Since they were based on their respective novels, their plots were unrelated to this first game.Reactions to the game were mixed, with many reviewers polarized in their opinions: some calling it a good adaptation of the novel; others, an extremely poor adventure game. Several reviews harshly criticized the game's character design and graphics as being archaic and outdated, whereas others praised aspects such as character dialogue and a captivating story." }},

In Persona 3, the player takes the role of a male high-school student who joins the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad (SEES), a group of students investigating the Dark Hour, a time period between one day and the next that few people are aware of. During the Dark Hour, the player enters Tartarus, a large tower containing Shadows, creatures that feed on the minds of humans. To fight the Shadows, each member of SEES is able to summon a Persona, a manifestation of a person's inner self. The game's most iconic feature is the method by which the members of SEES release their Personas: by firing a gun-like object called an Evoker at their head. In addition to the standard elements of role-playing games, Persona 3 includes elements of simulation games, as the game's protagonist progresses day by day through a school year, making friends and forming relationships that improve the strength of his Personas in battle. Reception of Persona 3 was mainly positive; critics enjoyed the game's social elements, while some found its combat and environments repetitive. Persona 3 FES's epilogue was said to give narrative closure to the original game, although it was criticized for not featuring the simulation aspect of Persona 3.

Originally published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 in 2000, Sin and Punishment takes place in the near future of 2007 when humanity is struggling with a global famine. Scientists develop a new species to raise as food, but the creatures revolt and war breaks out. The player takes on the roles of Saki and Airan as they fight to save Earth from destruction. The game employs a unique Nintendo 64 controller layout, utilizing both the D-pad and control stick. This control scheme allows the player to strafe, jump, and dodge around the screen while simultaneously aiming the targeting reticle. The player must shoot at enemies and projectiles while also dodging attacks to survive and progress through the game. The development of Sin and Punishment lasted longer than usual for the era. Development commenced in 1997 with only four staff and concluded in 2000 with more people involved than in any of Treasure's previous projects. The guiding inspiration to develop Sin and Punishment was the design of the Nintendo 64 controller. Treasure wanted to make a game that had the player holding the left side of the controller instead of the right which was typical across the system's library. The Treasure team encountered difficulties programming the game, citing the system's complex 3D rendering capabilities and difficulties adapting 2D gameplay ideas into 3D environments. Originally titled Glass Soldier by Treasure, the game was retitled to Sin and Punishment by Nintendo, wanting a name that stood out. Sin and Punishment was released to positive reviews. Critics highlighted the game's intensity and flashy graphics, and particularly pointed out Treasure's ability to reduce the game's polygon count to maintain smooth gameplay action while still keeping the graphics stylish. Since the game was never released in the west, it grew a cult following among import gamers, and it quickly became one of the most demanded titles for the Wii Virtual Console after its announcement. It was finally released in western territories through the Virtual Console in 2007 to positive reviews. In retrospect, Sin and Punishment is considered one of the best Nintendo 64 games. It was ported to the iQue Player in China in 2004, and a sequel was released for the Wii in 2009, Sin and Punishment: Star Successor." }},

It takes place in an alternate-history 1950s, where the creatures from Golden Age monster movies are played by real monsters who lead otherwise normal lives. Controlling reporters Sue Bergman and Ron Ashman, the player seeks to unravel a mystery surrounding the murder of Frankenstein's monster. In the process, the player undertakes a globetrotting journey to locations like Transylvania and Egypt, while solving puzzles and interacting with characters such as Count Dracula, the Invisible Man and the Mummy. Development of Hollywood Monsters began at Pendulo in mid-1994. The company sought to heavily improve its design practices, graphics production and engine technology over those of its first game, Igor: Objective Uikokahonia (1994). While Igor had involved six people, Hollywood Monsters required roughly 40 contributors, most of them outside contractors. Pendulo's goal was to create a traditional adventure game with nonlinear gameplay and difficult puzzles. At the request of Dinamic, the team worked with Spanish new wave group La Uni\u00F3n to create a theme song for Hollywood Monsters. After a challenging development cycle that lasted two-and-a-half years, the game was released in Spain during December 1997. The game drew attention in Spain as a major release from the country's small game industry, which had collapsed after the golden age of Spanish software. Spanish publications cited it as evidence that domestic games were maturing; listeners of the popular radio program Game 40 voted it the best Spanish-made game of 1997. In Spain, Hollywood Monsters sold 250,000 units and helped to establish Pendulo as an important developer. However, the game's planned English version was never released, as Pendulo failed to find publishers beyond Southern Europe. The game has retrospectively been labeled a \"classic\" by Spanish outlets, and as one of the country's greatest graphic adventure games. Longstanding fan demand led to the spiritual successor The Next Big Thing (2011), named Hollywood Monsters 2 in Spain." }},

It tells the story of Adrienne Delaney (Victoria Morsell), a writer who moves into a remote mansion and finds herself terrorized by supernatural forces. It was made at the peak of popularity for interactive movie games and features live-action actors and footage, both during cinematic scenes and within the three-dimensionally rendered environments of the game itself. It was noted for its violence and sexual content. Williams had long planned to design a horror game, but she waited eight years for software technology to improve before doing so. More than 200 people were involved in making Phantasmagoria, which was based on Williams' 550-page script, about four times the length of an average Hollywood screenplay. It took more than two years to develop and four months to film. The game was originally budgeted for $800,000, but it ultimately cost $4.5 million to develop and was filmed in a $1.5 million studio that Sierra built specifically for the game. The game was directed by Peter Maris and features a cast of twenty-five actors, all performing in front of a blue screen. Most games at the time featured 80 to 100 backgrounds, while Phantasmagoria includes more than 1,000. A professional Hollywood special effects house worked on the game, and the musical score includes a neo-Gregorian chant performed by a 135-voice choir. Sierra stressed that it was intended for adult audiences, and the company willingly submitted it to a ratings system and included a password-protected censoring option within the game to tone down the graphic content. Phantasmagoria was released on seven discs after multiple delays, but it was a financial success, grossing $12 million in its opening week-end and becoming one of the best-selling games of 1995. Sierra strongly promoted the game. It received mixed reviews, earning praise for its graphics and suspenseful tone while being criticized for its slow pacing and easy puzzles. The game also drew controversy, particularly due to a rape scene. CompUSA and other retailers declined to carry it, religious organizations and politicians condemned it, and it was refused classification altogether in Australia. The sequel Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh was released in 1996, although Williams was not involved." }},

By the middle of July 2005, the mini-game's discovery attracted considerable controversy from lawmakers and politicians, prompting the game to be re-assessed with an \"Adults Only (AO)\" rating by the U.S. Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), and refused classification in Australia, resulting in its removal from sale. An updated version of San Andreas has since been released with the mini-game removed completely, allowing the game to regain its original rating. A patch for the original version of the game, Cold Coffee, was designed to counter edit the script and disable the mini-game and crash the game if one attempts to access it." }},

The game was made available on the Wii's Virtual Console service on June 10, 2008. The game stars Autobot protagonist Ultra Magnus. The titular Mystery is the identity of Optimus Prime's (referred to in the title as \"Convoy\") killer, as the 1986 film did not see a Japanese release for another four years. Thus, Optimus Prime's death was not adequately explained to the Japanese audience; this game was intended to capitalize on that gap. Although the game title is The Transformers: Mystery of Convoy, \"Convoy\" is misspelled as \"Comvoy\" on both the game box and the cartridge (see above). It was also highly requested by many people to be featured in a DVD Special episode of the hit Japanese television show GameCenter CX (known outside Japan as Retro Game Master), which was seriously accepted by the show's staff. Tele Tele TV Magazine ran a contest in their December 1986 issue to win an exclusive limited edition silver-plated cart of the game. Only 50 were made and given to the first of those 50 who sent in a postcard with their name, address and favorite Transformer.

A high-definition remastered port for the Nvidia Shield TV was released exclusively in China in December 2017.The game's plot is similar to those of other side-scrolling Super Mario games. New Super Mario Bros. Wii follows Mario as he fights his way through Bowser's henchmen to rescue Princess Peach. Mario has access to several power-ups that help him complete his quests- ones which both recur from previous Super Mario entries, such as the Super Mushroom and Fire Flower, and brand new ones, such as the Propeller suit and the Penguin Suit- each of which give him unique abilities. While traveling through up to nine worlds with a total of 80 levels, Mario must defeat Bowser's children (the Koopalings and Bowser Jr.), Kamek, and Bowser himself before saving Princess Peach. The first Super Mario game to feature simultaneous co-op multiplayer gameplay, up to 4 people can play at the same time, controlling Mario, Luigi, and one of two colored toads, in both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. The game also introduces \"Super Guide\", a feature created by Nintendo which allows the player to watch a difficult level be played through once by a computer-controlled player before making another attempt to complete it.Announced and released following a drop in profits, Nintendo released the game hoping that it would rejuvenate sales of the Wii Console. To highlight the uniqueness of the game, Nintendo chose to use a red keep case instead of the traditional white. New Super Mario Bros. Wii was both critically and commercially successful, receiving particular praise for its multiplayer aspect, though some critics were disappointed in the game's lack of new content compared to previous Super Mario titles.

Announced at Gamescom 2014, the game is an expanded remake of the 2013 PlayStation Vita game Tearaway, which had also been developed by Media Molecule. The game takes place in a vibrant storybook-type world made entirely out of paper. The player gains control of either Iota or Atoi, a messenger tasked with delivering a letter to a portal in the sky called 'the You', which has mysteriously been opened. Along the way, the messenger must save the world from Scraps, small villainous creatures which are invading the paper world via the opening to cause disruption. Tearaway Unfolded's gameplay revolves around environmental platform interaction, creativity and customizability, confrontations with Scraps and other antagonistic creatures, mini-quests issued by non-playable characters, and finding collectibles. The player, who controls several aspects of the world in a god-like fashion, navigates the messenger through the environments by changing the landscape. For example, in order to help Iota/Atoi advance through a specific section, the player may have to trigger bounce pads, rotate platforms, illuminate objects, cast gusts of wind, or hurl objects, to trigger the solution and allow progression. The player is tasked with designing objects for use in the game's world, which are mostly used to solve people's problems or requests, but may also be used for decorative purposes. The messenger is given several helpful tools over the course of the game, which introduce new gameplay mechanics, and, among other things, allow for alternate methods of traversal. Tearaway Unfolded was met with a positive critical reception upon release. Critics mostly praised the game's controls, visuals, characters, and world design. Some critics disliked the emphasis on optional controllers, while others felt that the original PlayStation Vita version was a more personal experience, and therefore, better overall." }},

Applications run on the server with a terminal known as a thin client (also known as an X terminal) handling input and output. Generally, terminals are low-powered, lack a hard disk and are quieter and more reliable than desktop computers because they do not have any moving parts. This technology is becoming popular in schools as it allows the school to provide pupils access to computers without purchasing or upgrading expensive desktop machines. Improving access to computers becomes less costly as thin client machines can be older computers that are no longer suitable for running a full desktop OS. Even a relatively slow CPU with as little as 128 MB of RAM can deliver excellent performance as a thin client. In addition, the use of centralized computing resources means that more performance can be gained for less money through upgrades to a single server rather than across a fleet of computers. By converting existing computers into thin clients, an educational institution can also gain more control over how their students are using computing resources as all of the user sessions can be monitored on the server. See . In its current form (v5.x), LTSP relies on distributions to integrate the LTSP architecture into their respective products. In the v4.x series, LTSP was an add-on package to any distribution.

It is present in OS X's Fink, Homebrew and MacPorts projects. Binary packages exist for most free Unix systems. Many vendors initially resist including md5deep as they mistakenly believe its functions can be reproduced with one line of shell scripting.

Interactive Entertainment. Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman and written by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini, Arkham Asylum was inspired by the long-running comic book mythos. In the game's main storyline, Batman battles his archenemy, the Joker, who instigates an elaborate plot to seize control of Arkham Asylum, trap Batman inside with many of his incarcerated foes, and threaten the fictional Gotham City with hidden bombs. Most of the game's leading characters are voiced by actors who have appeared in other media based on the DC Animated Universe; Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, and Arleen Sorkin reprised their roles as Batman, the Joker, and his sidekick Harley Quinn respectively. The game is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets that can be used in combat and exploration. Batman can freely move around the Arkham Asylum facility, interacting with characters and undertaking missions, and unlocking new areas by progressing through the main story or obtaining new equipment. The player is able to complete side missions away from the main story to unlock additional content and collectible items. Combat focuses on chaining attacks together against numerous foes while avoiding damage, while stealth allows Batman to conceal himself around an area, using gadgets and the environment to silently eliminate enemies. Development began at Rocksteady Studios in May 2007, with a 40-person team that expanded to 60 people by the project's conclusion after approximately 21 months. Among others, the game design was inspired by Batman-penned works of Neal Adams and Frank Miller, and Grant Morrison's Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth graphic novel. Built on Unreal Engine 3, Arkham Asylum's production underwent several variations, refining both gameplay such as the combat system, and the central story, resulting in the removal of plot elements and some of Batman's main enemies, who did not fit the tone of the rest of the game. Rocksteady began developing ideas for a sequel months before Arkham Asylum's completion, hiding hints to the sequel within the game. Arkham Asylum was released worldwide for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles on August 25, 2009, followed by a Microsoft Windows version on September 15. The game received critical acclaim, particularly for its narrative and combat. Reviewers called it the \"greatest comic book game of all time,\" and the \"best superhero game of modern times.\" It won several awards, including Best Action Adventure game, Best Game, and Game of the Year from various media outlets, and it held the Guinness World Record for \"Most Critically Acclaimed Superhero Game Ever\". It has been cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. The game received several re-releases, including a Game of the Year edition in March 2010, a Mac OS X version in November 2011, and a remastered version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in October 2016. Arkham Asylum's success launched the Batman: Arkham series, comprising video game sequels and spin-offs, comic books, merchandise, and movies, beginning in October 2011 with its direct sequel Arkham City." }},

    { "software": { "type": "uri", "value": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/IBM_Integration_Bus" }	, "abstract": { "type": "literal", "xml:lang": "en", "value": "IBM APP Connect Enterprise (abbreviated as IBM ACE, formerly known as IBM Integration Bus or WebSphere Message Broker) is IBM's integration broker from the WebSphere product family that allows business information to flow between disparate applications across multiple hardware and software platforms. Rules can be applied to the data flowing through the message broker to route and transform the information. The product is an Enterprise Service Bus supplying a communication channel between applications and services in a service-oriented architecture. IBM ACE provides capabilities to build solutions needed to support diverse integration requirements through a set of connectors to a range of data sources, including packaged applications, files, mobile devices, messaging systems, and databases. A benefit of using IBM ACE is that the tool enables existing applications for Web Services without costly legacy application rewrites. ACE avoids the point-to-point strain on development resources by connecting any application or service over multiple protocols, including SOAP, HTTP and JMS. Modern secure authentication mechanisms, including the ability to perform actions on behalf of masquerading or delegate users, through MQ, HTTP and SOAP nodes are supported such as LDAP, X-AUTH, O-AUTH, and two-way SSL. A major focus of IBM ACE in its latest release is the capability of the product's runtime to be fully hosted in a cloud.  Hosting the runtime in the cloud provides certain advantages and potential cost savings compared to hosting the runtime on premises as it simplifies the maintenance and application of OS-level patches which can sometimes be disruptive to business continuity. Also, cloud hosting of IBM ACE runtime allows easy expansion of capacity by adding more horsepower to the CPU configuration of a cloud environment or by adding additional nodes in an Active-Active configuration. Another advantage of maintaining ACE runtimes in the cloud is the ability to configure access to your ACE functionality separate and apart from your internal network using DataPower or API Connect devices. This allows people or services on the public internet to access your Enterprise Service Bus without passing through your internal network, which can be a more secure configuration than if your ESB was deployed to your internal on premises network. IBM ACE embeds a Common Language Runtime to invoke any .NET logic as part of an integration. It also includes full support for the Visual Studio development environment, including the integrated debugger and code templates. IBM Integration Bus includes a comprehensive set of patterns and samples that demonstrate bi-directional connectivity with both Microsoft Dynamics CRM and MSMQ. Several improvements have been made to this current release, among them the ability to configure runtime parameters using a property file that is part of the deployed artifacts contained in the BAR file. Previously, the only way to configure runtime parameters was to run an MQSI command on the command line. This new way of configuration is referred to as a policy document and can be created with the new Policy Editor.  Policy documents can be stored in a source code control system and a different policy can exist for different environments (DEV, INT, QA, PROD). IBM ACE is compatible with several virtualization platforms right out-of-the-box, Docker being a prime example. With ACE, you can download from the global Docker repository a runtime of IBM ACE and run it locally. Because ACE has its administrative console built right into the runtime, once the Docker image is active on your local, you can do all the configuration and administration commands needed to fully activate any message flow or deploy any BAR file. In fact, you can construct message flows that are microservices and package these microservices into a Docker deployable object directly. Because message flows and BAR files can contain Policy files, this node configuration can be automatic and no or little human intervention is needed to complete the application deployment." }},

Released for Microsoft Windows and macOS in March 2010, it is the ninth game in The Settlers series. Blue Byte released three expansions in 2010; Uncharted Land (German: DLC Pack 1), Conquest - The Empire (German: DLC Pack 2), and Rise of the Rebellion (German: DLC Pack 3), released in July, September, and December, respectively. In March 2011, The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom - Deluxe Gold Edition was released, containing the original game, the three expansions, an unlock code for an upcoming fourth expansion, and a copy of The Settlers III. The fourth expansion, The Two Kings (German: Die zwei K\u00F6nige), was released in April 2011. In 2018, the Deluxe Gold Edition was re-released as The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom - History Edition. In the game's single-player campaign, the player controls Princess Zo\u00E9 of the Kingdom of Kuron. When her father, King Konradin, learns there has been a coup in the neighbouring Kingdom of Tandria, with the Tandrian king, Balderus, forced into exile, he tasks Zo\u00E9 with putting down the rebellion. Making her way through Tandria, she soon encounters the leaders of the rebellion, Lord Wolvering and his most loyal knight, Dracorian. However, telling Zo\u00E9 that he is a liberator, not a rebel, Dracorian claims that he is fighting to rid the Tandrian people of Balderus's tyranny, and warns her not to trust her father. The Chronicles of Tandria, a campaign included with the Rise of the Rebellion expansion, tells a prequel story depicting how and why Dracorian and his sister Rovyn first took up arms against Balderus. In designing Paths to a Kingdom, Blue Byte explicitly set out to correct the perceived problems of the two previous Settlers titles; Heritage of Kings (which had been criticised for focusing too heavily on combat) and Rise of an Empire (which had been criticised for its overly simplistic economic models). Roughly basing the game on the most acclaimed title in the series, The Settlers II, the designers foregrounded such popular features as road networks and complex daisy-chain economic processes, whilst emphasising economic micromanagement, technology trees, and trade requirements. However, the designers also introduced new game mechanics, particularly a dynamic Victory Points system. Additionally, for the first time in the series, the player can choose to develop their settlement along three different lines; military, technology, and/or trade, with each one requiring different gameplay strategies and styles of play. Shortly after the game's release, it became embroiled in controversy when a fault in Ubisoft's newly launched always-on DRM prevented thousands of players from playing the game over the Easter weekend. Paths to a Kingdom received generally positive reviews, with many critics citing it as the best Settlers game since The Settlers II. Especially lauded were the graphics, Victory Points system, mission variety, and map design. In terms of criticisms, the game's DRM problems were addressed by most reviewers, although many acknowledged the fact that these problems were not the fault of the game's designers. The single-player storyline was also poorly received. At the 2010 Deutscher Entwicklerpreis, the game won two awards; \"Best German Game\" and \"Best Strategy Game\"." }},

McDonald's Video Game is a parody of the business practices of the corporate giant McDonald's, taking the guise of a tycoon-style business-simulation game. The game presents the player with four views: The farmland, the slaughterhouse, the restaurant and the corporate HQ. Through each of these views, decisions can be made which will affect the fate of the player's company. In the game, the player takes on the role of a McDonald's CEO by choosing whether or not to feed the player's cows genetically altered grain, plow over rainforests or feed the player's cattle to other cattle (a practice known to spread mad cow disease). The player can also choose advertising strategies and public official corruption to counteract opponents of the player's actions. Some choices within the game, such as the opportunity to demolish villages or bribe public officials, paint the corporation in a negative light. These aspects of the game are unflattering to McDonald's, who issued a statement saying that the game \"has no association with McDonald's and is therefore a complete misrepresentation of our people and our values.\" On some websites, La Molleindustria released a version of the game called Burger Tycoon which is exactly the same except that it eliminates all mention of McDonald's such as the franchise logo and a bear replacing the Ronald McDonald mascot. This was done in order to avoid copyright sanctions. The game has been translated into nine languages: English, Spanish, Italian, Finnish, Danish, Turkish, Portuguese, French and German." }},

Sega adopted the IOC's mission of promoting sportsmanship and interest young people in the Olympics by using its characters; following this theme, Nintendo allowed Sega to include Mario with Sonic the Hedgehog, created by Sega as a mascot to rival Mario in the early 1990s.

It was one of the first WYSIWYG editors that could write mathematical formulas, even on IBM PC XT computers that were then common. The editor was more oriented to speed and interactive aspect of editing, rather than on visual appearance of the result, therefore, it has its own graphical user interface with bitmap fonts of fixed width. Although popular (easier to use than TeX for many scientists), this unfortunately led to its demise as more text editors with vector fonts for MS Windows began to appear, and in 1996, it has been discontinued. The basic idea of ChiWriter is that you can add lines above or below the current text line (by half of the base line height), and write text there too. The additional lines are treated as part of the original text line. This can be used to create subscripts and superscripts, and also more complex formulas such as fractions. Combined with the possibility to use several fonts (up to 20) at once, such as Greek alphabet, Cyrillic alphabets, and mathematical and other symbols, ChiWriter is quite easy to write mathematical texts in. Every font has the same fixed dimensions, but you can use different sets for different output devices (for example, you can use low-resolution fonts for screen and high-resolution fonts for printer). You can also manually create the larger objects (such as sums and integrals) by using several symbols for each part of the object. The editor was quite customizable. There was also a font editor, which allowed to modify fonts and introduce user-designed fonts (including proportional ones) and symbols. Recently people experience some difficulty with exhibiting ChiWriter documents. A simple solution takes into consideration the fact that in the quality printing mode ChiWriter outputs bit-image print codes which can be redirected into a file (default extension .bin). In the heydays of the editor, the codes Epson ESC/P were the most frequently used. Utility chipbm converts used by ChiWriter subset of bit-image print codes into a file Portable anymap (.pbm) which is loaded by many graphical utilities. For example, utility GIMP allows saving a page afterwards in Portable Document Format (.pdf). For creating .bin files containing bit-image print codes, we can launch the editor under MS-DOS in VirtualBox." }},

It is in open beta. The development team was initially composed of students from the Entertainment Technology Center at Carnegie Mellon University. Players control anthropomorphic characters and purchase a variety of aircraft to fly to different areas called Skylands, taking part in combat and trading as they do so. There are over 19,500 registered characters as of October 2012, and there are generally between 30 and 200 people online at any one time. Players in Skyrates progress through the game mostly through purchase of planes, upgrades and guns for their planes. Players may compare their progress via leaderboards, or a system to search players based on their various stats. As it is in development Skyrates often resets all players' progress with a new version whenever the game has changed substantially. Skyrates is at version 2.7, the last version update having occurred February 2012. Inspired in part by TaleSpin, a 1990s-era Disney cartoon series, Skyrates is set in a world recovering from an apocalyptic war which reduced the remaining viable landmass to a collection of scattered islands. Ripped from the ground and cast adrift in the sky through the use of \"unobtainium\", these Skylands carried with them the last remnants of civilization. Now split into several color-coded factions, the descendants of these survivors travel and trade between the Skylands and are preyed upon en route by air pirates operating from smaller, unmapped \"skylets\"." }},

UNHCR sought advice from Ume\u00E5 University regarding interactive media for schools, and discussed ideas with the Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training and the Swedish Integration Board. UNHCR decided to proceed the project as a web-based game, a medium which could reach a large number of young people, require no distribution costs and minimal marketing costs. The game was aimed at 12 - 15 year olds, an age where people began to develop ideas regarding refugees and similar issues.

It was launched on May 12, 2008. The objective of this project is to predict the structure of proteins of major strains of rice. The intent is to help farmers breed better rice strains with higher crop yields, promote greater disease and pest resistance, and utilize a full range of bioavailable nutrients that can benefit people around the world, especially in regions where malnutrition is a critical concern. Determining the structure of proteins is an extremely difficult and expensive process. Though it is possible to computationally predict a protein's structure from its corresponding DNA sequence, there are thousands of distinct proteins found in rice. This presents a computational challenge that a single computer cannot solve within a reasonable timeframe. Once that the entire rice genome had been sequenced, the effort shifted to identifying genes that are involved in increased yield, disease resistance and nutritional value. This problem is made more difficult because very few cereal plants have been sequenced, and therefore, many of the rice genes do not resemble any genes of known function. The Computational Biology Research Group at the University of Washington developed the Protinfo software, which can produce protein structures at a fraction of the cost and time. Protinfo is being used to create three-dimensional models of the tens of thousands of rice proteins. These models are then used to predict the function of each protein and to understand the role of the gene that encodes it. The models, and any analysis resulting from examining them, will be housed at the Bioverse database and webserver, which is a comprehensive framework to relate molecules such as proteins and DNA to an organism's pathways and systems. Volunteers' computers on World Community Grid will run the Protinfo software to create models of all proteins encoded by the rice genome whose structure can be predicted reliably. These models will be analyzed to choose the best ones. From the resulting structures, prediction tools will determine the function of each protein and the role of the gene that encodes it. Using the power of Protinfo, World Community Grid will initially examine over 10,000 genes, and produce 100,000 models per gene. Eventually, the structures of 30,000 to 60,000 proteins will be studied. Generating one billion models on the 320 CPU cluster at the Computational Biology Research Group was anticipated to take about 30 years to accomplish; however, using World Community Grid took only about two years working at 167 TFLOPS. The distributed computing function was suspended in April 2010 while in-house analysis of results continues. The DC function will resume when funding is secured for further phases. The resulting knowledge base will hopefully lead to the development of improved hybrids of rice strains with higher yield, greater disease and pest resistance, and a full range of bioavailable nutrients.

In today's world of communications, most people know of Local Area Network (LAN) which is based on Ethernet, a network system used in personal computers where one PC is able to talk to another PCs. In embedded systems, RS-232 TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) has dominated the market over a longer period of time as the most common communication standard that also works as an internal embedded network system. With the use of MAX 232 integrated circuit (IC), the RS-232 TTL may connect to an external RS-232 connection where the immediate advantage of using MAX 232 is that there is no need of using positive and negative power supply. It is also possible to connect to USB via RS-232 to USB converter, and even if the original standard for RS-232 was basically a point-to-point system for the serial port on PCs, it is still possible to use RS-232 in small local area network using micro-controller and source code to control the signals and data transmission. A DOLLx8 embedded network uses its own specific interface system named DOLLx8 Dataport that via DOLLx8 eMaster unit connects to external RS-232 and from there to USB directly, but requires the installation of a separate DOLLx8 driver. DOLLx8 runs on its own internal clock system that allows the DOLLx8 Dataport bus speed to be independent of the RS-232 baud speed set on the PC side, and can thus be determined by the user. With DOLLx8, USB works as a virtual communication port and can be set to a maximum speed of 128,000 Kbps." }},

A port for the PlayStation Vita was announced in August 2014, and released on December 12, 2017. Papers, Please has the player take the role of a border crossing immigration officer in the fictional dystopian Eastern Bloc-like country of Arstotzka, which has been and continues to be at political hostilities with its neighboring countries. The game takes place at the border of East and West Grestin, a fictional parallel East/West Berlin. As the immigration officer, the player must review each immigrant and returning citizen's passports and other supporting paperwork against an ever-growing list of rules using a number of tools and guides, allowing in only those with the proper paperwork, rejecting those without all proper forms, and at times detaining those with falsified information. The player is rewarded in their daily salary for how many people they have processed correctly in that day, while being fined for making mistakes; the salary is used to help provide shelter, food, and heat for the player's in-game family. In some cases, the player will be presented with moral decisions, such as approving entry of a pleading spouse of a citizen despite the lack of proper paperwork, knowing this will affect their salary. The game deals with the issues of keeping up with immigration policy in an ever-changing political environment. In addition to a story mode which follows several scripted events that occur within Arstotzka, the game includes an endless mode that challenges the player to process as many immigrants as possible. Pope came upon the idea of passport-checking as a gameplay mechanic after witnessing the behavior of immigration officers through his own international travels. He coupled this with a narrative inspired by spy thriller films, having the immigration officer be one to challenge spies trying to move in or out of countries with fake travel documents. He was able to build on principles and concepts from some of his earlier games, including his The Republia Times from which he also borrowed the setting of Arstotzka. Pope publicly shared details of the game's development from its onset, leading to high interest in the title and encouraging him to put more effort into it; though he initially planned to only spend a few weeks, Pope ended up spending about nine months on the game. Papers, Please was positively received on its release, and it has come to be seen as an example of an empathy game and a demonstration of video games as an art form. The game was recognized with various awards and nominations from the Independent Games Festival, Game Developers Choice Awards, and BAFTA Video Games Awards, and was named by Wired and The New Yorker as one of the top games of 2013.

The game was created to demonstrate what Bogost felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of social games, such as the promotion of social interaction and monetization rather than the artistic aspects of the medium.

It usually refers to features in software or computer systems which are rendered unusable to most users by the complexity of the interface to them. The usage emanates from the 'clock' feature provided on many VCR's manufactured in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The clock could be set by using a combination of buttons provided on the VCR in a specific sequence that was found complicated by most users. As a result, VCR users were known to seldom set the time on the VCR clock. This resulted in the default time of '12:00' blinking on the VCR display at all times of the day, which is the origin of this term. \"In most surveys, the majority of people have never time-shifted just because they don't know how to program their machines,\" said Tom Adams, a television analyst for Paul Kagan Associates, a media research firm, in 1990. In software, 'the blinking twelve problem' thus refers to any situation in which features or functions of a program go unused for reasons that the designers never anticipated, largely because developers were unable to anticipate the level of understanding the users would have of the technology. The term may also refer to the challenge faced by developers of addressing the real causes of users' difficulties, as well as the challenge of providing helpful documentation or technical support without knowing beforehand how well the user understands their own problem. In other instances, it can be used to reference the lack of basic user-friendly features in complex systems; stemming from the lack of a backup battery to keep the clock setting in a $300 VCR during even the briefest power interruption, when a $10 clock would have one. The terms is usually used mostly by geeks, often in discussion forums. The term appears in the 1999 essay In the Beginning... Was the Command Line by Neal Stephenson." }},

The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Arcade in 2011. Described as a spiritual successor to Populous, the game revolves around The Breath, which was summoned by a tribe to help them seek and recover their lost knowledge. In the game, players, controlling a cursor, can manipulate matter such as lava, soil, and water. Players can help the tribespeople to overcome challenges including finding different totems and overcoming natural disasters. In addition to the story mode, the game features a Challenge mode which offers a shorter, but harder experience.Originally starting its life as a strategy game, From Dust marked the return of Chahi to the video game industry following an extended sabbatical after the completion of his last game, Heart of Darkness. The project was created as a result of his fascination with volcanos, and his desire to combine the ambivalence and violent characteristics of their nature in a new video game. The team was further inspired by African and New Guinean tribes, Conway's Game of Life, works of Polish painter Zdzis\u0142aw Beksi\u0144ski, and Koyaanisqatsi. Some features, such as the biological life cycle of the tribespeople, were left out of the game because of the huge amount of work they would require. Ubisoft was originally doubtful about the project but was later convinced by Chahi. The game was made by a small team within the Montpellier studio, so was considered an independent game produced by a large publisher. The game was announced at E3 2010 as Project Dust.The game received a generally positive reception on release, with critics praising the game's physics, simulation, openness and graphics, while criticizing the game's artificial intelligence and camera angles. Opinions on the game's Challenge mode and mission design were polarizing. The PC version of the game fared worse than other platforms for its technical issues and digital rights management. The game was a commercial success for Ubisoft, selling over half a million copies and became Ubisoft's fastest-selling digital game.

It was released in November 2013 for Japan and February 2014 for North America, Australia and Europe. A port to Microsoft Windows through Steam was released in December 2015 followed by iOS and Android in Japan during February 2016. The game is a direct sequel to Final Fantasy XIII-2, concludes the storyline of Final Fantasy XIII, and forms part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries. Lightning Returns employs a highly revamped version of the gameplay system from the previous two games, with an action-oriented battle system, the ability to customize the player character's outfits, and a time limit the player must extend by completing story missions and side quests. The game's story takes place five hundred years after the previous game's ending. Lightning, the main protagonist of the first game and a key character in the second, awakes from a self-imposed hibernation 13 days before the world's end, and is chosen by the deity Bhunivelze to save the people of the dying world, including former friends and allies who have developed heavy emotional burdens. As she travels, she learns the full truth behind both the world's fate and Bhunivelze's true agenda. Development of the game started in May 2012, shortly after the release of XIII-2's final piece of DLC, and was unveiled at a special 25th Anniversary Event for the Final Fantasy series in September that year. Most of the previous games' key creative minds and developers returned, and it was developed by Square Enix's First Production Department, with developer tri-Ace helping with the graphics. The development team wanted the game to bring a conclusive end to the story of both Lightning and the XIII universe, and to address criticisms leveled against the last two games. During its first week on sale in Japan, it sold 277,000 units, and by the end of 2013 become the 17th best-selling game of the year selling over 400,000 copies. It has sold 800,000 copies as of May 2014. It has received mixed reviews: while the main praise went to the game's battle system, opinions were more mixed for the graphics, time limit and other aspects of gameplay, while the story and characters were criticized for being weak or poorly developed. In September 2014, Square Enix announced the Final Fantasy XIII series has been widely successful and has shipped over 11 million copies worldwide. Final Fantasy series brand manager Shinji Hashimoto revealed in October 2016 that Lightning Returns met sales expectations and that Square Enix is satisfied with it. On November 13, 2018 it was added to Xbox One Backward Compatibility along with its prequels making it playable on the console. It is also Xbox One X Enhanced allowing it to display in 4K Ultra HD." }},

Ephemeral content is an increasingly important form of Internet communication because it allows people to communicate spontaneously, without concern for whether that communication will be recorded. This is the idea of the \"Forever Internet\" versus the \"Erasible Internet\". The Erasible Internet allows for all the interactivity, but also allows users to control and erase their content.

It was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in August 2017, with an Xbox One version in April 2018 that was later added to the Xbox Game Pass in December 2018. The game features support for virtual reality, which was added in an update in 2018. A Nintendo Switch version was released on April 11, 2019. Inspired by Norse mythology and Celtic culture, Hellblade follows Senua, a Pict warrior who must make her way to Helheim by defeating otherworldly entities and facing their challenges, in order to rescue the soul of her dead lover from the goddess Hela. In parallel, the game acts as a metaphor for the character's struggle with psychosis, as Senua, who suffers from the condition but believes it to be a curse, is haunted by an entity known as the \"Darkness\", voices in her head known as \"Furies\", and memories from her past. To properly represent psychosis, developers worked closely with neuroscientists, mental health specialists, and people suffering from the condition. The game blends several genres, including hack and slash, puzzle solving, and psychological horror. Voice acting is an integral part of the game, while its cutscenes combine motion capture by Melina Juergens, and live action performances by other actors. Hellblade was a commercial success and was well received by critics, who praised it as a work of art and applauded its uncommon choice of revolving around psychosis, the quality and uniqueness of its approach of the condition, and its story and main character. Its overall presentation, along with Juergens' performance, were also considered superior in quality to what independent games usually provide, although its gameplay and other elements received some criticism.

The game was released for the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows in early 2017, with an Xbox One port later in June 2018. Nier: Automata is a sequel to the 2010 video game NieR, a spin-off sequel of the Drakengard series. Set in the midst of a proxy war between machines created by otherworldly invaders and the remnants of humanity, the story follows the battles of a combat android, her companion, and a fugitive prototype. Gameplay combines role-playing elements with action-based combat and mixed genre gameplay similar to that of Nier. Production began in 2014, with series creator Yoko Taro, producer Yosuke Saito, and lead composer Keiichi Okabe returning to their respective roles, as well as Square Enix artist Akihiko Yoshida in charge of character design. The story is based around themes similar to Yoko's earlier works, such as people's impulse to kill and nihilism, while also incorporating issues such as confronting prejudice and escaping difficult situations. The goal was to make a Nier game true to the spirit of the original, while simultaneously crafting a better combat system. As a project entirely new to the developers, the staff at PlatinumGames faced multiple challenges when developing its gameplay and open world environment. Upon release, Nier: Automata was met with positive reviews, with critics praising the game's narrative, characterization, thematic depth, music design, combat system, and mixture of different gameplay genres. Minor criticism was leveled at some of the game's visual and technical problems. By May 2019, the game had shipped over 4 million copies worldwide." }},

Babelfy is based on the BabelNet multilingual semantic network and performs disambiguation and entity linking in three steps: \n* It associates with each vertex of the BabelNet semantic network, i.e., either concept or named entity, a semantic signature, that is, a set of related vertices. This is a preliminary step which needs to be performed only once, independently of the input text. \n* Given an input text, it extracts all the linkable fragments from this text and, for each of them, lists the possible meanings according to the semantic network. \n* It creates a graph-based semantic interpretation of the whole text by linking the candidate meanings of the extracted fragments using the previously-computed semantic signatures. It then extracts a dense subgraph of this representation and selects the best candidate meaning for each fragment. As a result, the text, written in any of the 271 languages supported by BabelNet, is output with possibly overlapping semantic annotations." }},

Prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light & transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses & usurpations begun at a distinguished period and pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty to throw off such government, & to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; & such is now the necessity which constrains them to expunge [alter] their former systems of government. The history of the present king of Great Britain is a history of unremitting [repeated] injuries & usurpations, among which appears no solitary fact to contradict the uniform tenor of the rest but all have [all having]in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world for the truth of which we pledge a faith yet unsullied by falsehood.HE has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome & necessary for the public good.HE has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate & pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained; & when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.HE has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature, a right inestimable to them, & formidable to tyrants only.HE has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.HE has dissolved representative houses repeatedly & continually for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.HE has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected, whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise, the state remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without & convulsions within.HE has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners, refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, & raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.HE has suffered [obstructed] the administration of justice totally to cease in some of these states [by] refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.HE has made our judges dependant on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, & the amount & paiment of their salaries.HE has erected a multitude of new offices by a self assumed power and sent hither swarms of new officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.HE has kept among us in times of peace standing armies and ships of war without the consent of our legislatures.HE has affected to render the military independent of, & superior to the civil power.HE has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitutions & unacknowledged by our laws, giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation:FOR quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:FOR protecting them by a mock-trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these statesFOR cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:FOR imposing taxes on us without our consent:FOR depriving us [in many cases] of the benefits of trial by juryFOR transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences:FOR abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging it's boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these states [colonies]:FOR taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments:FOR suspending our own legislatures, & declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in allcases whatsoever.He has abdicated government here withdrawing his governors, and declaring us out of his allegiance & protection. [by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us.]He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, & destroyed the lives of our people.He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation & tyranny already begun with circumstanccs of cruelty and perfidy [scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, & totally] unworthy the head of a civilized nation.He has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends & brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.He has [excited domestic insurection among us, & has] endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, & conditions of existence.He has incited treasonable insurrections of our fellow-citizens, with the allurements of forfeiture & confiscation of our property.He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating it's most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating & carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither. This piratical warfare, the opprobium of INFIDEL Powers, is the warfare of the CHRISTIAN king of Great Britain. Determined to keep open a market where MEN should be bought & sold, he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this execrable commerce. And that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished die, he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them, by murdering the people on whom he also obtruded them: thus paying off former crimes committed against the LIBERTIES of one people, with crimes which he urges them to commit against the LIVES of another.In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injuries.A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a [free] people who mean to be free. Future ages will scarcely believe that the hardiness of one man adventured, within the short compass of twelve years only, to lay a foundation so broad & so undisguised for tyranny over a people fostered & fixed in principles of freedom.Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend a [an unwarrantable] jurisdiction over these our states [us]. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration & settlement here, no one of which could warrant so strange a pretension: that these were effected at the expense of our own blood & treasure, unassisted by the wealth or the strength of Great Britain: that in constituting indeed our several forms of government, we had adopted one common king, thereby laying a foundation for perpetual league & amity with them: but that submission to their parliament was no part of our constitution, nor ever in idea, if history may be credited: and, we [have] appealed to their native justice and magnanimity [and we have conjured them by] as well as to the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which were likely to [would inevitably] interrupt our connection and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice & of consanguinity, and when occasions have been given them, by the regular course of their laws, of removing from their councils the disturbers of our harmony, they have, by their free election, re-established them in power. At this very time too they are permitting their chief magistrate to send over not only soldiers of our common blood, but Scotch & foreign mercenaries to invade & destroy us. These facts have given the last stab to agonizing affection, and manly spirit bids us to renounce forever these unfeeling brethren. We must endeavor to forget our former love for them, and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends. We might have been a free and a great people together; but a communication of grandeur & of freedom it seems is below their dignity. Be it so, since they will have it. The road to happiness & to glory is open to us too. We will tread it apart from them, and [We must therefore] acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our eternal separation! [and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.]We therefore the representatives of the united States of America in General Congress assebled [appealing to the Judge of the World for the recititude of our intentions] do in the name & by authority of the good people of these states [colonies] reject and renounce all allegiance & subjections to the kings of Great Britain & all others who may hereafter claim by, through or under them: we utterly disolve all political connection which may heretofore have subsisted between us & the people or parliment of Great Britain: and finally we do assert and declare these colonies to be free and independent states, [solemly Publish and Declare that these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be, Free and Independent States; that they are dissolved from allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political Connection between them and the State of Great-Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved;] and that as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract allies, establish commerce, & do all other acts & things which independent states may of right do.And for the support of this declaration, [with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence] we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, & our sacred honor.

It was released in Japan in June 2015, and released internationally in August 2016. The player controls Warrior of Light (Wol), a man who wakes with amnesia in the world of Palamecia, and must help conquer the dark forces attacking its people. The game features gameplay elements from previous Final Fantasy titles, including leveling, exploration via standard navigation and fast-travel systems, and turn-based combat tied to a job system. Common themes were also drawn from the original Final Fantasy title, such as \"warriors of light\" and their fight against chaos and darkness. The game, which began development in early 2014, was developed around the concept of a mobile game on a similar level to a home console game and \"a rich gaming experience, anytime, anywhere\". This prompted skepticism from both in-house staff and external sources. While some assets were outsourced, most of the development was done internally by Square Enix's Business Division 1. Multiple staff from previous Final Fantasy titles were involved in development, including producer Yoshinori Kitase; director Motomu Toriyama, project leader Naoki Hamaguchi, character designer Toshiyuki Itahana and composer Mitsuto Suzuki. The game registered over two million players within the first few weeks of release. Square Enix cited Mobius Final Fantasy as one of the most successful mobile titles they released in 2015, having over three million downloads in Japan before the end of the year. The English version also reached one million downloads within a week, with over three million in under a month. The graphics and gameplay were praised by reviewers, although some called the overall combat experience \"simple\". It was awarded as one of the Apple App Store's best games of 2015 in Japan. It was also awarded for being the most beautiful game on the Google Play Store in 19 countries for 2016. Mobius surpassed 10 million downloads in January 2017 with millions more since. In May 2019 ahead of the Japanese version's 4th anniversary Square Enix announced that the game had reached 20 million downloads worldwide." }},

Players assume the role of Hajime, a man who is about to get a full-time job and is looking for a date. This is done by entering a VR-machine in a popular attraction called \"May Club\" (pun on \"make love\"), where players interact with people from across great distances as if they were right there with them. The number of tickets to access May Club are limited however, so players must plan when to enter May Club to meet the woman of their choice. There are ten women in all and each one is very different. This game focuses on many different themes, from S&M, to lesbianism, to a lolita complex. The game is known to be quite difficult, due to the planning needed on when to enter May Club to meet the right people, as players can enter in the morning, afternoon, or evening on any given day. The game has a time limit, and by a certain date, the game is over, regardless of whether players managed to get a girlfriend or not. However, each of the women players meet while in the VR machine has a secret they are hiding, ranging from the fairly normal to the absurd. Because the VR space isn't as secure as the company thinks, anything could be possible. One woman is a hacker set out on having fun exploring the virtual space. Just how much she's affected is up to you to find out. Two hentai scenes were deleted from the English version of the game because in those scenes, the characters, Misato and Kirara, appeared to be underage by US standards. However, the programmers removed the images only from the game, not the programming, and with a hex editor or patch, the scenes can be viewed.

The game was released worldwide on 14 September 2018 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with a further release on macOS and Linux set for 2019. Set shortly after the events of Rise of the Tomb Raider, its story follows Lara Croft as she ventures through the tropical regions of the Americas to the legendary city Paititi, battling the paramilitary organization Trinity and racing to stop a Mayan apocalypse she has unleashed. Lara must traverse the environment and combat enemies with firearms and stealth as she explores semi-open hubs. In these hubs she can raid challenge tombs to unlock new rewards, complete side missions, and scavenge for resources which can be used to craft useful materials. Development began in 2015 following the completion of Rise of the Tomb Raider, lasting until July 2018. Shadow of the Tomb Raider was designed to conclude Lara's journey begun in the 2013 reboot, with a key theme being descent both through the jungle environment and into her personality. The setting and narrative was based on Mayan and Aztec mythologies, consulting historians to design the architecture and people of Paititi.

Released worldwide on December 1, 2017, it is the third instalment in the Xenoblade Chronicles series, and the seventh main entry in the Xeno meta series; although it features a different setting and characters than the first Xenoblade Chronicles, it marks a return to a story-driven game, unlike the previous game in the series, Xenoblade Chronicles X, which was oriented towards open world exploration. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 takes place in Alrest, a world covered in a sea of clouds. Humans live on top of and inside living creatures known as Titans, together with Blades, powerful beings that can be summoned by certain humans named Drivers, and to whom they are tied for the rest of the Driver's life. After he is hired for a salvaging mission, a young Driver named Rex is killed, but revived by a legendary Blade named Pyra on the promise of taking her to Elysium, a fabled paradise at the top of the World Tree. Together with other Drivers and Blades, the duo, caught in a war between countries, attempts to reach the World Tree, while being chased by Torna, an elusive faction seeking to capture Pyra. Development of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 began shortly before the launch of Xenoblade Chronicles X. Several key people from previous Xenoblade Chronicles games returned including franchise creator, executive director and co-writer Tetsuya Takahashi and directors Koh Kojima and Genki Yokota. Using their experience from X, the team wanted to develop a story-driven game in the style of the original Xenoblade Chronicles. The soundtrack was composed and arranged by Yasunori Mitsuda, ACE, Kenji Hiramatsu, and Manami Kiyota. The main characters were drawn by Masatsugu Saito, best known for his work in Expelled from Paradise, while Tetsuya Nomura designed the characters of Torna; many guest artists were hired to design the Blades unrelated to the main story. Gameplay-wise, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is similar to previous entries, with the notable addition of the Blades, three of whom the player can switch between during a battle; most Blades in the game are optional, and must be \"awakened\" from a Core Crystal, resulting in a randomly selected Blade becoming tied to a specific Driver, who can use them in combat. The game was first announced alongside the Nintendo Switch reveal presentation in 2017, with a worldwide release date planned for the same year. Similarly to the original Xenoblade Chronicles, the game's localization was handled by Nintendo of Europe. Unlike the controversy surrounding Xenoblade Chronicles X, the game does not feature any sort of censorship between different versions. Upon release the game received generally positive reviews, with most praise going to its story, combat, music, environments, and amount of content. At over 1.5 million copies sold as of September 2018, it is the best-selling title in the Xeno series, and Monolith Soft's most commercially successful game. A large story-based downloadable content (DLC) addition taking place 500 years before the main game and featuring its own game mechanics, titled Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna \u2013 The Golden Country, was released in September 2018." }},

The idea for the game came from neuroscientist Michael Hornberger of the University of East Anglia who collaborated with Hugo Spiers of University College London and a group of six other neuroscientists. The game was designed to help researchers to understand the mental process of 3D navigation, which is one of the first skills lost in dementia. It was hoped that a large number of people would play the game, thus contributing much more data than could easily be obtained in a laboratory experiment. The plot of the game involves a sea journey taken by a son in a quest to recover the memories his father has lost to dementia. There are three sections: navigation, shooting flares to test orientation, and chasing creatures. Each has been \"carefully crafted to be as fun and exciting as it is scientifically valid\". It was named \"App of the week\" by BT. It won nine Cannes Lions at the 2016 International Festival of Creativity. By February 2017, the game had been downloaded 2.7 million times. In August 2017, Sea Hero Quest came in a virtual reality edition. The game was nominated for the 2018 British Academy Games Awards, in the new category \"Game Beyond Entertainment\" for games which \"deliver a transformational experience beyond pure entertainment\".

Taking place in modern-day Tokyo and featuring real-life locations such as Shibuya and Harajuku, the game centers around evil beings known as Mirages who seek to harvest an energy known as Performa from humans and are responsible for several disappearances. The story follows a group of teenagers who become allied with friendly Mirages, based on characters from the Fire Emblem series, and merge with them to become Mirage Masters. Under the guise of the Fortuna Entertainment talent agency, the Mirage Masters fight to protect innocent people from the Mirages and find out who is behind the attacks. The game was first proposed by Nintendo producer Kaori Ando, who envisioned a crossover between the Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei series. Although initially reluctant due to their workload, Atlus agreed to the collaboration, and much of the early work went into deciding what genre of game it was going to be and how best to incorporate both series while creating an original game. The production period lasted five years. A notable feature was musical numbers produced by Japanese entertainment company Avex Group. The game was announced two months after full development began. Due to its Japanese setting and aesthetic, its Western release retains the Japanese voice track with subtitles rather than an English dub. Reception of the game was generally positive; many praised the battle system, reactions to the story were mixed to positive, and other elements such as dungeon designs and a lack of Fire Emblem-related elements were criticized along with technical problems.

A few days later, children from the township began to disappear, and the terrified villagers began to flee \u2014 with only the local magistrate, Jonah, and the township's chaplain, Father Hale Goodfellow, remaining behind. Father Goodfellow is convinced that a supernatural force is at work; Jonah, a skeptic, refuses to believe this, assuming Kedward is behind the kidnappings and is still at large near the town. There are also two people who are locked in a jail in the town: Hirrum Heathtow is a drunk, and Elizabeth Styler is a supposed witch who was arrested when she was found in Elly's house, reciting strange phrases. The player must guide Prye through his investigation, to discover what happened to Elly Kedward. In his search, he happens upon a child having been bound and tortured in the forest. After freeing the child, a voice warns him not to interfere before sending zombies onto him. In the forest, Prye meets a shaman by the name of Asgaya Gigagei, who tells him of the legend of Hecaitomix, an evil spirit once worshipped by the Natives before white settlers first arrived. Angered that he's no longer revered, Hecaitmox plans to destroy the human race and conquer the world. Prye learns that Hecaitomix has abducted a number of children for sacrificial murder, and makes it his quest to rescue them. Prye's journey not only takes him throughout the woods, but into the spirit realm which Hecaitmox conquered, but the demonic realm which he already rules. While rescuing Hecaitomix's hostages and facing his minions, Prye eventually faces Hecatomix himself, with Asgaya's help. After escaping Hecaitomix's realm, Prye encounters Styler, who reveals herself to be a servant and vessel of Hecaitomix. The two fight, with Prye managing to defeat her (either by killing her or exorcising the demon from her body). If Styler is killed, Prye is thanked by the townspeople for having rescued the children and is offered a job as a constable, which Prye declines, having regained his faith and returns to his church to resume his previous position. Exorcising Styler results in a different ending where she returns to her senses and thanks Prye, explaining that she had been under the demon's influence all throughout the story. She asks Prye to come with her, hinting at a romantic partnership. Prye declines, reaffirming his faith and desire to return to his flock. Prye and Styler share a goodbye and part ways." }},

Its development began in 2016, after NBCUniversal approached Frontier Developments about creating a game to accompany the theatrical release of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. To do this, Frontier staff inspected different dinosaur models and reference materials sent by Universal, watched the Jurassic Park films, read the novels and fan theories. The team consulted paleontologist Jack Horner when they designed the dinosaurs. Jeff Goldblum, Bryce Dallas Howard and B. D. Wong reprised their roles from the Jurassic Park film series, voicing remarks to players and contributing to the game's narrative.

It is a companion game to Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative survival game with construction elements. It was initially released in early access on September 26, 2017, for Microsoft Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, followed by ports for iOS, Android, and the Nintendo Switch the following year. The concept of the game is similar to previous games of the genre: 100 players skydive onto an island and scavenge for gear to defend themselves from other players. Players can fight alone (Solo), with one additional player (Duos), or with a group of up to three others (Squads). As the match progresses, the playable area within the island gradually constricts, giving the players less and less room to work with. The last player or team alive wins the match. The main distinction from others in the genre is the game's construction elements, which can give advantages based on skill level and utilization. Battle Royale uses a seasonal approach with battle passes to introduce new character customization content in the game, as well as limited time events, some of which correspond with changes to the game map. Since its initial release, several other game modes have been introduced, including \"Playground\", which somewhat serves as a training mode. The idea for Battle Royale arose following the release of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, a similar battle royale game that was highly successful, but was noted for its technical flaws. Originally released as part of the early access version of Save the World, Epic later transitioned the game to a free-to-play model funded by microtransactions. Following its rise in popularity, Epic split the development team, with one focusing on Battle Royale and the other on Save the World. Battle Royale received positive reviews from critics, who praised its learning curve, gameplay, art style, and progression system, but noted its similarity to previous games in the genre. The game quickly rose in popularity following its release, eventually surpassing Battlegrounds in overall player count and revenue. By March 2019, the game had been played by over 250 million people and had generated over 2 billion dollars worldwide. The game has gone on to become a cultural phenomenon, with promotion through social media and several celebrities, including Ninja, Marshmello, and Drake, contributing to the game's popularity, achieving record high viewerships on streaming websites in the process." }},
